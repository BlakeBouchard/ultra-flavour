Yeah, it's gonna rain from time to time. But you can always keep things smooth, greasy, like the absolutely *sleazy* saxophone in this song. Pour a cup of green tea, make some cinnamon toast. Make an oddly relaxed noise, like "Oouuuggghhh." There. Now you're having a rainy day.
## The "Scenes" of the Post-5E Fantasy TTRPG genre
Speaking of things with a bit more of a somber tone, I have been looking at the surprising growth of the OSR scene over the past couple of years. It seemingly coincides nicely with the OGL 1.1 oopsie, which shows that there were maybe a lot of people using D&D 5e in a way that is perhaps better supported by OSR-style games like Old School Essentials.

One of the peculiarities about D&D is that it often regarded as the “kitchen sink” game, and many players independently arrive at the conclusion that that must mean “it’s equally good for every type of player.” But when you take a closer look, you realize that it’s compromising itself in some big ways. Specifically in its Attrition model, as well as how it dumbs its own tactical rules down to better support “Theater-of-the-Mind” style play.

So if you were a player who preferred that more gritty, horror-oriented style of play that was the rage in the 70’s and 80’s, and you had suddenly decided that D&D 5e was no longer the thing you wanted to throw your money at, you had some very good options. A whole scene, in fact, of OSR players waiting with open arms to bring you into the fold.

What I think a lot of D&D-to-OSR converts find is that there are a lot of ways that smaller games still create the style of play they’re looking for, without the baggage of all that post-3rd Edition wargaming stuff. And that’s great… If you’re someone who doesn’t like the post-3rd Edition wargaming stuff. If you DO like that stuff, your options are significantly different.

At the time of this writing, if you were a person who wanted to drop 5th Edition like a bad habit, but also don’t find the OSR style of play appealing, then right now you have three really good options: **Pathfinder**, **Lancer**, and **Fabula Ultima**. And then a bunch of solid-but-not-particularly-exciting options, like about 95% of the PbtA-adjacent RPGs on itch.io.
## The Four Faces of Fantasy
Each of the three games I mentioned combine with the OSR to make up the four post-5e “Scenes” in the fantasy TTRPG genre:

- The **Old-School Renaissance**, which I’ve already described a bit of;
- The **Simulation/Systems Mastery** scene, represented by **Pathfinder**;
- The **Heroic Character-first Fantasy** scene, represented by **Lancer** and other games inspired by D&D 4th Edition;
- The **Storytelling/Narrative Fantasy** scene, represented by **Fabula Ultima** as well as many other games in the PbtA and Forged in the Dark genres.

The scenes that seem to be the most well-represented are the OSR, Systems Mastery, and Narrative scenes.

OSR and Narrative games tend to be rules-light compared to games in the other two scenes, and require less balancing, so they are cheaper to produce.

Because of the nature of Systems Mastery players, who prefer to invest deeply in one set of rules, there only ever really needs to be one or two major games in that scene. Hence why the existence of Pathfinder is plenty good enough for these types of players.
## The Character Fantasy Renaissance
This leaves one scene in particular out in the cold: The Character-first Heroic Fantasy scene, represented mainly by Lancer and other games inspired by D&D 4th Edition such as Gubat Banwa and ICON.

The major differentiator between the character fantasy scene and others is that the rules are much more built around supporting a particular character fantasy than they are in creating a simulation or a narrative. Those things come secondary to making the characters feel as much like the fantasy they represent.

That means that if your character fantasy revolves around being, say, a "Monster Hunter," then the rules aren't going to get in the way of that too much. Rather, your investment in the rules rewards you with a character that is powerful without having to put too much effort into making them that way.

Contrast this with a game like Pathfinder, or an OSR game. In those games, making a powerful character is either difficult or impossible. You need the aforementioned systems mastery to make your Pathfinder character as powerful as a 5e character, and even then it's likely they'll still feel relatively hamstrung compared to a 5e character of similar level.

And an OSR character is weak by design: You're not supposed to be able to overcome the challenges of the world by simply casting a spell or rolling a check. You're supposed to use your critical thinking skills to solve the problems that your character is confronted with, or... They die! Not much point in thinking up an epic, years-long arc when you're only one sprung pit trap away from an early end.

If you're a person who is still playing 5th Edition as of this writing, it's highly likely that you're either a character fantasy player or a narrative player. The OSR and Pathfinder players already have plenty of what they need.

For narrative-oriented players, you might look at something like Fabula Ultima. You could also do one of the many PbtA or Forged in the Dark games out there, like Blades in the Dark for example. But if you're still looking for that D&D experience, your best options as of this writing are probably Dungeon World or Burning Wheel.
# Next Time
That's about all I want to get to today, but next time I'll probably talk about a couple of upcoming games that I think are really going to help the "character fantasy" and "narrative" scenes take prominence in the post-5e era: **Daggerheart**, and **Draw Steel**.
