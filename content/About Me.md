Hi! I'm Blake Bouchard, a Canadian Software Engineer in the Mobile Games Industry.

I graduated from the University of Alberta with a Bachelor of Science in Computing Science, minor in Sociology. I was also one of the first-ever recipients of the U of A Certificate of Game Development.

I reside in Western Canada, currently in the Vancouver area of British Columbia. I'm not currently engaged in an active job search, so please don't email me about jobs! There are a bunch of people out there who are desperate for work, so stop trying to throw a job at me who is currently employed!
# Interests
## TTRPGs
I'm an avid fan of Tabletop Roleplaying Games. The games I'm most interested in are [Draw Steel](https://mcdm-rpg.backerkit.com/hosted_preorders), [Daggerheart](https://www.daggerheart.com/), [Lancer](https://massifpress.com/lancer), and any games in the [LUMEN](https://gilarpgs.itch.io/lumen) system (notably [NOVA](https://gilarpgs.itch.io/nova) and [Infinite Revolution](https://gwencie.itch.io/infinite-revolution)).

I have done a bit of writing on TTRPGs over on my [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/blog/ultraflavour), but going forward I'll probably be writing that stuff here and linking to it from there!
## Pro Wrestling
I post about Pro Wrestling over on my Bluesky account: [@blakebouchard.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/blakebouchard.bsky.social)

I'm a fan of AEW and TJPW, secondarily NJPW and CMLL, among others. Support your local indies!
