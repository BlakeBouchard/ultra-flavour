In my [[Rainy Days and Heroic Fantasy|previous article]], I talked a bit about what I saw as being the 4 "scenes" of the fantasy TTRPG community: The Old School Renaissance, the Simulationist/Systems Mastery scene, the Narrative/Storytelling scene, and the Character Fantasy scene.

I wanted to define the character fantasy genre a little bit better. It might not be obvious how a "Character Fantasy" game differs from other fantasy games that are combat-heavy such as 5E and Pathfinder. So let's get into that.

Character fantasy games are games that:

1. Support the fantasy that the players' characters represent first and foremost. So if someone plays a "Monster Hunter," then the game should provide plenty of monsters for that character to successfully hunt, and many interesting ways that being a Monster Hunter changes how that player is able to interact with the world.
2. Make the characters powerful, so that they can act in a way that fulfills their fantasy without fear of being randomly killed. Character fantasy games, as a rule, do not include "Surprise Death" mechanics, rather they prefer to let the players decide when (or if) their character dies.
3. Center their narratives around the backgrounds, beliefs, and actions of the players' characters. In character fantasy games, the players are the primary drivers of the story. In the essay [Six Cultures of Play](https://retiredadventurer.blogspot.com/2021/04/six-cultures-of-play.html) by [The Retired Adventurer](https://retiredadventurer.blogspot.com/), this would be considered "Neo-Trad."

I would submit that the games that best exemplify this style of play at the time of this writing are **Lancer** and **Fabula Ultima**. Both are games that put a lot of power in the hands of the players to make the types of character they want, and they also enforce "GM cooperation" by including rules that give the players agency over the narrative:

- In Lancer, the rules around mission structure include a planning phase that mandates that the GM works together with the players to decide on what mission the group takes on next;
- In Fabula Ultima, the players get "Fabula Points" that they can spend for a sort of temporary "GM fiat" that allows them to introduce new story elements into the narrative.

These games also make the players generally more powerful than your average D&D character. Lancer characters have access to 15-foot-tall suits of mechanized armour with advanced weaponry and even "paracausal" systems. Meanwhile, Fabula Ultima characters are able to perform "Rituals" that allow them to create arbitrary magical effects, though often at a significant risk.
## The Post-OGL Character Fantasy Wave
In the aftermath of the OGL 1.1 debacle, a wave of major games were announced to target almost all of the various sub-scenes of the D&D community:

- Shadowdark, an OSR-style game that uses mostly the same mechanics as D&D 5th Edition;
- DC20, a rethink of the rules of 5th Edition that keeps its core assumptions mostly intact, though rewrites most of the rules;
- Draw Steel, a combat-focused TTRPG that rethinks the entire "Power Fantasy" of D&D;
- Daggerheart, a more narrative-forward game that uses "fail forward" and meta-currencies to encourage the players to act in a forward manner, regardless of success or failure.

Shadowdark is very "[OSR-like](https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/blogs/shadowdark-blog/all-about-shadowdark-rpg)" and DC20 is a much more Simulation style challenge game. That leaves Draw Steel and Daggerheart to uphold the Character Fantasy and Narrative scenes, respectively.

So why are Draw Steel and Daggerheart so different from what DC20, Pathfinder and 5E are offering? What are the major differences? Let's examine them.
## Draw Steel
Matt Colville was one of the first major D&D personalities to definitively state that he was breaking away from the Wizards-owned brand and making his own game. His gamble was risky, but it paid off with a record-breaking crowdfunding campaign that stands as the highest-grossing TTRPG campaign not based on a pre-existing IP. Thus we get Draw Steel, formerly known as "The MCDM RPG."

It is also a love letter to a forgotten branch of D&D's evolution: 4th Edition, the grid-based game with powers for everyone (not just the spellslingers). Draw Steel picks up on that design thread, and moves it forward in meaningful ways.

While many other "post-5E" games like DC20, Core20, Nimble 5E and the Cosmere RPG are hewing much more closely to the assumptions of 5th Edition, Draw Steel seems to prefer to throw a lot of those ideas out in favour of a much more "Heroic" style of play. It breaks the traditional attrition model of D&D in a big way, preferring to reward players for pushing themselves further into the dungeon, rather than forcing them to be circumspect about how they spend their resources.

"Victories" are a resource in Draw Steel, which goes against the more "Classic/OSR" idea that monsters are a thing to be avoided, rather than a thing to be fought against. Even the most recent fantasy games like 5E and Pathfinder hold to the model that your character is the strongest they'll ever be at the start of the day, and dwindle in power and vitality as the day wears on. In Draw Steel, the characters are actively encouraged to fight the random goblin encounter, rather than skip it to save resources.

This pairs with a much less punishing Death mechanic, which removes the "Death Saving Throw" and allows the player to continue to act after they've been knocked down, but also allows them to simply stay down and not risk bleeding out on the floor of the dungeon. This is a significant difference between Draw Steel and the "Trad/Neo-Trad" games that it's looking to supplant.
## Daggerheart
Critical Role also made a bit of a splash in the months following the OGL 1.1 situation. Though their initial response to the difficulties was very diplomatic, the real response would come during the April 2023 "State of the Press" livestream when they announced their own fantasy TTRPG called "Daggerheart."

Like Draw Steel, Daggerheart also diverges quite strongly from the core assumptions of D&D. Specifically, it adds a "fail forward" or "random complications" system to its core dice mechanic, which makes the game feel much more like a "Powered by the Apocalypse" type game than most other games in the D&D tradition would.

This philosophy extends to its combat, which is much more based around meta-currencies than strict initiative ordering. Players take actions in whichever order they please, and can even take multiple turns in a row, though each action they ~~take fills up the GM's "action token" pool, which determines how many actions their NPCs can take when control shifts to them~~. EDIT: Haha whoops, this became untrue literally as I was typing it out!

As in other "Neo-Trad" games, the characters are the primary drivers of the action. The storytelling prompts emerge primarily from the players' action rolls, specifically from the "Hope/Fear" outcomes of the roll. This mechanic alone changes how you can run a D&D game. The GM no longer acts as the primary storyteller, but rather is required to react much more to what the players are doing.

As of this writing, Daggerheart has *just* gone into [pre-order](https://www.daggerheart.com/pre-order/). Literally while I was writing this.
## Fantasy: The Next Generation
For me, these games represent the next generation of the fantasy genre, building off of the world that was done prior to 5th Edition and Pathfinder reshaping the entire genre in their image.

Games like D&D 4th Edition, Dungeon World, 13th Age, the Fantasy Flight Narrative Dice games (Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 3rd Edition, Star Wars: Edge of the Empire, the Genesys games) were an evolutionary offshoot of the fantasy genre that got mostly cemented over by the rise of Pathfinder and 5th Edition in the early-to-mid-2010's. With new games like Draw Steel, Daggerheart, Lancer and Fabula Ultima (among some other notable indie games that I'll probably talk about in a future post), we're finally seeing the resumption of those dropped design threads that got trampled on by the kaiju-like rise of 5E.

A bit ironic that it's Critical Role that's picking up some of those threads, considering the fact that they can very rightly be credited for the meteoric rise of the game that helped to destroy those early 2010s games. But better late than never, right?
