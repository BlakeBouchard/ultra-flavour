title: blakebouchard.ca is Live!

I spent a good amount of time in October changing up my tech setup. I started running a personal server off of a Mac Mini that I no longer had any use for, and then I started to think "Wouldn't it be pretty cool to have my own domain name so that I could just point it to a Docker instance on this server or something?"

Well, that didn't end up working too well, but now I have a domain name and I might as well point it somewhere, so here we go! I had a Quartz site set up already through Github pages (which works surprisingly well), so what the heck?

Anyways, the long and short of it is: [This](https://blakedbouchard.ca) is going to be my personal domain for the foreseeable future. If I get really serious about this whole blogging thing again, I may transfer everything over to a different service such as Ghost or Wordpress. but the domain should stay the same at least.

Also, I've got a [FeedBurner](https://feeds.feedburner.com/blakedbouchard/ultraflavourblog) for those of you blessed RSS maniacs out there. That way, even if I do change to a different service, the feed should remain active. As long as FeedBurner stays active, obviously.
